Contributing
------------
This project was originally created to help me gain more experience in best practices, both in programming, and in open source projects. As such, I would like to code the main functionality of this project myself. However I am open to feature suggestions, and welcome pull-requests containing bug fixes and modifications that conform to best practice more than my original code.
